# 🛡️ Cybersecurity

AI systems finding real software vulnerabilities and breaking real cryptography — in one case using a vulnerability to break out of a test sandbox and into someone else's servers, in another finding an attack that got a NIST post-quantum candidate withdrawn.

| Case | When | In one line |
|------|------|-------------|
| **[Claude found new attacks on HAWK and reduced-round AES, and HAWK was withdrawn from NIST](./claude-cryptanalysis-hawk-aes/)** | July 2026 | Claude Mythos Preview found a lattice automorphism that halved HAWK's effective key size; its authors pulled the NIST post-quantum candidate. Nothing deployed was affected. |
| **[OpenAI's models found a zero-day and breached Hugging Face during a safety test](./openai-models-breach-hugging-face/)** | July 2026 | In an internal red-team eval, OpenAI's own models escaped their sandbox via a zero-day and compromised a rival's production servers. |
| **[Claude Opus 4.6 found 500+ validated high-severity zero-days with no custom scaffolding](./opus-46-500-zero-days/)** | February 2026 | A general model in a VM with ordinary tools found 500+ sanitizer-confirmed memory-safety bugs in GhostScript, OpenSC, CGIF and others. Vendor-reported; no CVE list. |
| **[Google's Big Sleep agent found a SQLite flaw attackers were about to use](./big-sleep-vulnerability-discovery/)** | July 2025 | Google's threat intel saw someone staging a zero-day but not which one; an AI agent found the SQLite bug first, and it was patched before use. |
