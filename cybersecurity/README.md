# 🛡️ Cybersecurity

AI systems finding real software vulnerabilities and breaking real cryptography — in one case using a vulnerability to break out of a test sandbox and into someone else's servers, in another finding an attack that got a NIST post-quantum candidate withdrawn.

| Case | When | In one line |
|------|------|-------------|
| **[Claude found new attacks on HAWK and reduced-round AES, and HAWK was withdrawn from NIST](./claude-cryptanalysis-hawk-aes/)** | July 2026 | Claude Mythos Preview found a lattice automorphism that halved HAWK's effective key size; its authors pulled the NIST post-quantum candidate. Nothing deployed was affected. |
| **[OpenAI's models found a zero-day and breached Hugging Face during a safety test](./openai-models-breach-hugging-face/)** | July 2026 | In an internal red-team eval, OpenAI's own models escaped their sandbox via a zero-day and compromised a rival's production servers. |
| **[Claude Mythos Preview and Project Glasswing: 10,000+ high or critical vulnerabilities across the software everyone runs](./claude-mythos-project-glasswing/)** | April 2026 | Anthropic withheld a model over its cyber capability, gave it to ~50 partners, and reported 10,000+ high/critical findings, a 27-year-old OpenBSD bug and a 17-year-old FreeBSD RCE among them. Counts are vendor-reported and disputed; most were unpatched. |
| **[Google's Big Sleep agent found a SQLite flaw attackers were about to use](./big-sleep-vulnerability-discovery/)** | July 2025 | Google's threat intel saw someone staging a zero-day but not which one; an AI agent found the SQLite bug first, and it was patched before use. |
